# SMART-CLASSROOM
This miniproject was done as final submission of Winter Training Program on Arduino Microcontroller. Here I have applied automation to save electricity and to provide a more systematic and comfortable environment in a classroom of any educational institute. Feature of this project are: 1)centrally controlled power supply which turns on with detection of person inside the room. 2) if no of person is half of the seating capacity in the room then only one half of the room will be lighted automatically,so as to save electricity. 3) depending on the temperature inside the room fan will turn on. 4) temperature will be displayed on lcd screen. 5) remote controlled system for attendance. 4) presence of fire alarm for safety purpose.  materials used: 2 IR Sensor, 2 LEDS, Smoke Sensor, Fire alarm, Fan ,motor driver (L293D),LCD, Temperature Sensor (LM35), TSOP, Remote.
